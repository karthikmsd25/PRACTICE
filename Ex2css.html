        <p>“The moon is a loyal companion.
            It never leaves. It's always there, watching, steadfast, knowing us in our light and dark moments, changing forever just as we do. Every day it’s a different version of itself. Sometimes weak and wan, sometimes strong and full of light. The moon understands what it means to be human.
            Uncertain. Alone. Cratered by imperfections.”
